Test console applications for search of stars in photos

In case of application launch without arguments opens a stanard OpenFileDialog, or uses the first argument as path to the file.
The application runs for search of centroid in the photo and writes the new photo with "_result" postfix on the same path.
The found stars in the result photo are circled with a red circle.
